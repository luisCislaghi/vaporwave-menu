### Cafe Menu - Vaporwave Aesthetic

Hi! I do love coffee and I also have my home cafe ☕. I have created this menu to share with my friends and family. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

## Experience

I have created this menu inspired by the vaporwave aesthetic and it's meant to be an experience. It's better viewed on a mobile device, as it was inteded for.

### You can enjoy it with music too 🎵

My favorites are:
[Windows96 - Rituals](https://youtu.be/kSo6LT0xPSQ?si=au8V4FK_ISkDeF3u)
AND
[Windows96 - Caligula](https://youtu.be/q7v9zazGZ9Q?si=ACpi8MRkeKQWJ6am)
